// byte-range locks are mandatory instead: while a holder is live, any read
// overlapping the locked coordination byte fails with a lock violation from
// every other handle, including another handle in the locking process itself.
// That is why a live-contention gate denial named the lock but not its holder
// on Windows while naming both on Linux: the holder record was never
// unreadable, only the byte range in front of it was.
//
// Retrying past the coordination byte reads the exact same bytes the holder
// wrote, minus its first one, which storeLockOwnerDocumentPrefix restores.
